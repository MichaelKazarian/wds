So, you study a foreign language. Perhaps you are studying it with a teacher, by textbook or online course. All this time, you are learning the rules to build the sentences, grammar. In addition to grammatical rules, you also study new words. Perhaps your teacher or textbook give them to you, or you meet a new one and decide to memorize it. Let's focus on this.

***

### Not all words are equal. Learn the right words only
Any language has a **core vocabulary**. It's the most common words used in the language. For intermediate English, [you need to know up to 7000 words](http://www.englishteachermelanie.com/study-tip-the-english-words-you-need-to-know/). Don't panic! Millions of people succeeded, and you can.  What should we do to achieve it?

#### Everyday practice
Before all, only everyday practice allows you to learn a language successfully. How it works read in "Part 1".

#### 1. Two directions
For example, I'm a native Ukrainian who learns English. Learn words in two directions:  **Ukrainian ➡ English** and **English ➡ Ukrainian**. In **English ➡ Ukrainian** case, you can understand English, but you can't find the right words to use. And vice versa, while studying only **Ukrainian ➡ English**, you can't understand English.

#### 2. Listen and repeat
You need to **listen** to the native speakers and try to repeat after them.

>For English, German, French, and Spanish, Word Dolphin supports speech recognition.

#### 3. Write
Writing helps to memorize words and recognize them in the text. But avoid write training by hand! 99% of visual information in print, so it takes extra time to identify the familiar word! To avoid this, learn the printed version.

***

Word Dolphin implements these points. 

Add unknown words to Word Dolphin and mark them to learn.

>For English, German, French, and Spanish, the app searches translation and pronunciation. If the app can't find human pronunciation, machine speaking will use.

Dictionaries can provide a lot of translations. But not all translations are equal. For example, **pass** has tens of translations but mainly used only 3-4. It's easy to learn 2-3 translations. It's easy to learn 2-3 translations, but more than five translations are difficult. For many languages, Google or Microsoft Translator shows the translation rating.

#### Words learning is not a race!
Don't learn too much from the start! If you try to learn too many words per time, you will lose to memorize them. Five or six words per day are well. After some practice, you can increase word numbers.

### New words learning with Word Dolphin
The below technique works well for me: 
* 1st learning. Memorize new words. This stage takes the most time.
* 2nd learning. After 15-30 minutes.
* 3rd learning. After 6-8 hours.
* 4th learning. After 24 hours.

If you have memorized all words properly, mark them learned.

> **Be honest** Word Dolphin suggests you translate words to test your skills. For each translated word, you decide if the answer right or wrong.

Ok, you have learned new words! My congratulations! But words training is the first important part of word learning. The next one is not to forget new words!
