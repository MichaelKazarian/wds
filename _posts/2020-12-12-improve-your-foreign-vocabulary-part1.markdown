Words learning taking a lot of time. Here I tell you about how to avoid typical problems.

***

What do you think is the most important thing when learning a language:
* a grammar that explains how to build sentences
* or filling your vocabulary
* maybe practice with native speakers?

All of that is important, but there is one condition. It's **MOTIVATION**. Someone likes to learn languages, and it's sufficient motivation. But what about others? They haven't fun of it. Therefore, they begin to learn the language if it's necessary. For example, you need to travel or have an important speech. Or you need to communicate with someone who does not know your language. In general, when you realize you **MUST**. Thus, if you have no motivation, you will not make progress in learning a language.

Why it's so important? Because language learning success depends on **DAILY** practice. Daily sessions immersive you in a language environment. Your practice may be various. Today you can learn new grammar. Tomorrow you learn new words or repeat learned.  The next day you combine words learning and reading exercises.

Split your language practice into several parts. For example, several minutes to learn new words in the morning and several minutes to repeat learned words in the evening.

***

You must stand for the first 40 days of the practice. Next, it will be easier. This is not my whim, but our bodies work in this way. Half of this time needs to adapt to the new activity. The rest of the time forming a habit to learn the language¹. After a habit is formed, it will be easier for you to learn the language.

***

I want to draw your attention to such an obstacle. From time to time, you will not be able to keep in mind even two words! It's normal. In this case, do not force yourself. Do some easy exercises. The main thing, the practice must not be interrupted.

If you have the motivation for daily training, Word Dolphin will help you to learn and keep in mind the words. But let's talk about this in the next parts.
