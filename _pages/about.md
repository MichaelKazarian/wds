#### Created for practical needs<br /><small>2017 - today</small>

Hello, I'm Mykhailo Kazarian, a Ukrainian native speaker and software developer. In 2017 I needed to increase my English vocabulary. At first, I wrote unknown words in a notebook and stickers. It worked well until the first hundred words, but then I saw significant lacks. The first and foremost problem that learned words are quickly forgotten. Therefore I should repeat learned words regularly. Some words are hard to remember so, you must repeat them additionally.
While I continued to learn new words, I wanted more: native speaker pronunciation, examples of usages, write words to better memorizing, etc.
The notebook with stickers did not satisfy these requirements. I started looking for a personal dictionary app. Desktop apps were not good for me because I learn words in different places. So I needed a mobile app. I wanted the app that provided at least the next requirements: my own dictionary, two-direction learning, pronunciation and writing training, and regular repeating. To my surprise, I failed to find something like that.
As a result, Word Dolfin was created in May 2017. Since then, I have added many features such as adding new words from any text, pronunciation training, searching for word definitions for English, Spanish, German, and French.
A lot of people like Word Dolphin. I hope this app will be useful to you.
